== PROJECT: ClerkPro

---

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: *Major Rework on User Interface (UI) to be capable of full traversal with just keyboard while supporting AutoComplete for the Command Line Interface (CLI), and OmniPanel.*
** What it does: reduces the mental workload of the user from having to carefully type commands and double checking the typed command or the user guide for supported commands and parameters.
** Justification: This feature enhances the user experience significantly because it provides optimal focus on primary tasks at hand to reduce visual and cognitive expenditure.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects interaction against existing UI components as the traversal have to be critically handled from component to component.
** Credits: None

* *Minor enhancement*: added history for the CLI that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T09-3/main/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/MainAppTest.java[MainAppTest.java]]
